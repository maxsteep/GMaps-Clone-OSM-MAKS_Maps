# High-Performance Google Maps Implementation Using OpenStreetMap Data

This repository showcases a **clean-room implementation** of Google Maps, built in **high-performance C++**, leveraging **binary data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project**. Developed entirely independently, this project includes an intuitive and feature-rich UI along with advanced pathfinding and navigation algorithms. It was a comprehensive endeavor that achieved professional-grade polish.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Dynamic Map Rendering**: Smooth, zoomable, and interactive maps using OSM data.
- **Route Planning**: Optimized routes for single and multi-destination trips.
- **Turn-by-Turn Navigation**: Real-time instructions based on precomputed paths.
- **Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding**: Conversion between human-readable addresses and geographic coordinates.
- **Search**: High-speed search functionality for locations, addresses, and points of interest.

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) Heuristics**: Efficient routing for multi-stop deliveries with custom heuristics.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Support for live traffic and dynamic recalculations.
- **Customizable UI**: Intuitive user interface inspired by modern mapping applications.
- **High-Performance Multithreading**: Parallelized algorithms to handle large-scale data efficiently.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Technical Details

### Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: C++ (highly optimized for performance).
- **Libraries Used**:
  - OpenStreetMap Data API
  - Nanoflann for geospatial data manipulation
  - Qt for the UI framework
  - Boost for advanced C++ features

### Algorithm Highlights
- **Pathfinding**:
  - Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for shortest path computation.
  - Custom heuristics for faster convergence in urban environments.
- **Map Rendering**:
  - Quad-tree indexing for real-time map rendering.
  - Binary data preprocessing for OSM data.
- **Optimization**:
  - Custom memory management to handle large datasets.
  - SIMD optimizations for computational geometry tasks.

### Unique Challenges and Solutions
- Handling **massive datasets** efficiently by preprocessing and storing data in binary formats.
- Designing a **scalable architecture** to accommodate real-time updates and future feature expansion.
- Overcoming computational limitations of the TSP by implementing effective heuristics.

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: GCC 9.0+ or MSVC 2019+
- **CMake**: Version 3.15 or higher
- **Qt**: Version 5.15 or higher
- Boost Libraries
- OSM data in binary format that you will have to supply - project ships without the OSM data due licensing contraints

### Building the Project
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running the Application
```bash
./maps_application
```

## Future Work
- Integration with real-time traffic APIs.
- Mobile application support for iOS and Android.
- Advanced predictive algorithms for user behavior.
